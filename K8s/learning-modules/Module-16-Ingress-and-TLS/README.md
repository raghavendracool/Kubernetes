# Module 16 — Ingress and TLS

## 1. What Will We Learn?

**Outcome:** Route HTTP traffic and understand controller responsibility.

## 2. The 3 Whys

1. **WHY #1 — Why Ingress? Many HTTP apps need managed entry points.**
2. **WHY #2 — Why controller? Ingress object is configuration; a controller implements it.**
3. **WHY #3 — Why TLS? Production HTTP should be encrypted in transit.**

## 3. Problem Before This Concept

Kubernetes objects should never be memorized as random YAML. First identify the operational problem, then understand the Kubernetes resource or component that solves it.

## 4. Easy Real-Life Analogy

Ingress is the rulebook; Ingress Controller is the traffic officer.

## 5. Core Architecture Mental Model

```text
Desired State
    ↓
Kubernetes API
    ↓
Controllers / Scheduler / Node Agents
    ↓
Actual State
    ↓
Continuous Reconciliation
```

## 6. What Happens Internally?

1. A user or controller sends a request to the API server.
2. The request is authenticated, authorized and validated.
3. Accepted desired state is stored through the Kubernetes API.
4. Controllers watch resources and reconcile dependent resources.
5. Scheduler assigns unscheduled Pods to suitable nodes.
6. kubelet works with the container runtime to start assigned containers.
7. Status is reported back and reconciliation continues.

Not every object uses every step, but this is the pattern students should recognize.

## 7. Hands-On Lab

Enable/install ingress controller and route student-web.local.

If this module contains a progressive `stage/` folder:

```bash
bash scripts/load-module.sh 16
cd kubernetes-live/manifests
kubectl apply -f .
```

## 8. Commands

```bash
kubectl get ingress -A
```

```bash
kubectl describe ingress student-web -n student-app
```

```bash
kubectl get ingressclass
```

For each command explain:
- resource;
- namespace;
- read vs change;
- expected success;
- common failure.

## 9. Validation

Start with:

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.lastTimestamp
```

Then validate the specific object taught in this module.

## 10. Break It Intentionally

Students must change one setting so the lab fails, capture evidence, restore it and validate the recovery.

## 11. Troubleshooting Flow

```text

kubectl describe

  ↓
Logs (if container/app issue)
  ↓
Config / resource / network / auth checks
  ↓

```

## 12. Production Best Practices

- Know your controller.
- Automate certificates in production.
- Use cloud-native controller integration on EKS.

## 13. Common Mistakes

- Copying YAML without understanding selectors or ownership.
- Using the `default` namespace for everything.
- Using `latest` in production.
- Applying changes before reading current status/events.
- Using cluster-admin to avoid learning RBAC.
- Troubleshooting at the wrong layer.

## 14. Interview Questions

1. Ingress vs LoadBalancer Service?
2. Does Ingress work without a controller?
3. Where can TLS terminate?

## 15. Student Assignment

1. Draw this concept without looking at notes.
2. Run the lab.
3. Save `get` and `describe` evidence.
4. Break one configuration.
5. Find root cause.
6. Fix it.
7. Explain the concept in under three minutes.

## 16. Cleanup

For isolated labs:

```bash
kubectl delete -f . --ignore-not-found
```

Shared objects may be retained when the next module builds on them.
